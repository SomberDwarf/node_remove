# node_remove

This python script is for editing the compressed sub files used in Barotrauma.  node_remove scans the compressed xml file for wire nodes and removes all intermediate nodes, leaving only the the origin and termination coordinates.

## Description

Sometimes wiring in the subeditor gets to be such a mess that it's easier to startover.  Also useful if you need a clean copy for mirroring.  This is a python based script that decompresses the sub file, edits the xml and recompresses the file.

## Getting Started

Run the script or binary.  Select file, a backup is created and the sub file is replaced with the changed version.
